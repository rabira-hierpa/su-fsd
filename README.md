# SU FSD

This project is a Next.js project that is used to demonstrate listing and sorting CSV data.
It makes use of `csvtojson` to convert the CSV data to JSON, and a custom sorting algorithm to sort the data.

Feel free to take a look at the deployed version of this project at [https://su-fsd-rho.vercel.app/](https://su-fsd-rho.vercel.app/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

# Run the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
